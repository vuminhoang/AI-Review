## The machine learning models affected by the feature magnitude are:
- Linear and Logistic Regression.
- Neural Networks.
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
- KNN, K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Tree-based like XGBoost, Random Forrest is not sensitive with feature magnitude!
