## AI Basic Review


### About me:
Hi, I'm Vu Minh Hoang, currently an AI Engineer Intern at [Guess that hehee] and senior student at Hanoi University of Science, VNU. I wrote this repo to review some basic knowledge about AI, ML, DL and NLP. 

Btw, sometimes I mix up the terms loss function and cost function in my writing. Actually, their concepts are quite clear: the loss function measures the error on a single sample, while the cost function evaluates the overall performance on the entire dataset, typically as the average or the sum of the losses. I hope you can understand and overlook this.

Notes: Most of what I write comes from things I’ve read somewhere and noted down. Therefore, the images and sometimes the content are things I’ve researched online and rewritten. I completely respect the copyrights of the original authors. This is simply a personal project to jot down interesting ideas in my own understanding, making it easier for me to review and revisit the knowledge later. It’s not intended to copy anyone’s work.

### Contents:
-  Basic ML: Concept of some ML algorithms, implement them in ipynb file using sklearn.
-  General knowledge about OOP, a little Python project using OOP.
-  Basic Deep Learning: Text and Image Processing, General Knowledge, and Architecture of some of the most popular DL models, implement them with Pytorch.
-  NLP Basic
